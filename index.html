        <p> So hello. My name is Chloé Landry. I graduated from my previous program Professional Writing and started my first year in Graphic Design. I was introduced through my previous program, as they had a mandatory Graphic Design class that really interested me.</p>

        <p>So far, I'm really enjoying classes, even the ones I struggled with last term. Somehow it's like my efficiency has imporved once we moved forward to the next term. Which I suppose is a good thing.</p>
